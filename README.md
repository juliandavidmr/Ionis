# `ionis` - Ionic utilities

Ionic utilities. Manager your applications.

### **Why ionis?**
Sometimes the process of generating a production APK is complex. There may be some typing errors in the certification commands, or you may have problems with jarsigned, keytool and others. So I developed `ionis` to accelerate the process of preparing the apk. For more information see the command `ionis prepare`.


## Installation

Since you probably already have `node`, the easiest way to install `ionis` is through npm:

```sh
$ npm install -g ionis
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repo and

```sh
$ make install
```
to install n to bin/ionis of the directory specified in the environment variable $PREFIX, which defaults to /usr/local (note that you will likely need to use sudo).

## Usage

Generate a release build of our app, targeted at each platform we wish to deploy on. [See](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/publishing.html)
```sh
$ ionis prepare
```

Run ionic server:
```sh
$ ionis serve
# or
$ ionis s
```
**Note:** _All Ionic flags are supported. i.e:_
```
$ ionis s --labs
```

Add a platform (android, ios).
```sh
$ ionis pf android
```

Build the application in release mode.
```sh
$ ionis release android
```
Build the application in release with  icons update.
```sh
$ ionis release android resource
```

All commands ionic are soported. [See](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)
